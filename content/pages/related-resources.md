[Swiss PDB Viewer](http://spdbv.vital-it.ch/) (Deepview) - an application that allows users to analyze several proteins at the same time.

[UniProtKB / Swiss-Prot Release 50.6 statistics](http://us.expasy.org/sprot/relnotes/relstat.html) - the manually annotated and reviewed section of the [UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB)](http://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb). It is a high quality annotated and non-redundant protein sequence database, which brings together experimental results, computed features and scientific conclusions.

Other Free Visualization Programs (free for academic use):

[RasMol](http://www.openrasmol.org/) - a program for molecular graphics visualization used to view macromolecules and to prepare publication-quality images.

[PyMol](http://pymol.sourceforge.net/) - an open-source molecular visualization system that can produce 3-D images of small molecules and biological macromolecules.

[Chimera](http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) - a free, downloadable program for interactive visualization and analysis of molecular structures and related data.

[Cn3D](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3d.shtml) - a web browser-based application that allows users to view 3-D structures from NCBI's Entrez Structure database.

[iMol](http://www.pirx.com/iMol/) - a free molecular visualization application for Mac OS X; can handle multiple file formats for small and large molecules, load multiple molecules, and move and rotate molecules independently. 

[JMV](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/jmv/) - a Java and Java3D based molecule viewer, which can be used alone or integrated into other programs; provides a variety of molecular representations, coloring styles, and stereoscopic rendering capabilities. 

[MolView](http://molview.org/) - an open-source web application for web-based data visualization; can be used for searching through various scientific databases such as compound databases, protein databases, and spectral databases.
